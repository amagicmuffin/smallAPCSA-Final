# What is this?
APCSA final project: an ascii game that uses inheritance. 

# How do I play?

## Installation
I made this on a Windows computer. If you don't have a Windows computer, some things might work differently. 
This game is smooth because of ANSI escape codes which don't exist on windows for some reason.
Use git bash.

Method 1 (The Simple One):
- WARNING: you can only play one version with this method. If you want to play an older or newer version, you have to use a different installation method.

Method 2: 
- you need to be able to compile java code with ```javac``` for this method to work. You may need to download the java jdk 8 for this. You may need to add javac to your PATH for this.
- grab whatever release you want from the right sidebar
- [cd](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cd) into ```out\production\APCSA Final Simple``` 
  - your console should look something like this: ```C:\Users\amuffin\Desktop\code\java\APCSA Final Simple\out\production\APCSA Final Simple>```
- run (type and then press enter) ```java Main```

Method 3:
- compile from the source if you know what you're doing.
